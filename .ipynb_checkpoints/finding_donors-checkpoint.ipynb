    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it\\'s clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "**Application**\n",
    "- Logistic regression models can be used to determine the probability of a company/institution opening a branch or HQ in a particular location, given characteristics of the company itself and the environment. This classification can be done using two categories (e.g. location A or not location A) or multiple categories (e.g. location A, B, C).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**\n",
    "- Logistic models are easy to implement and the training is very efficient. This means that logistic models can serve as starting points, or benchmarks for more complex models.\n",
    "- These models are also widely used because of the implementational efficiencies, and do not require extraordinary computational resources\n",
    "- Logistic models are very useful because they not only classify data, but can also provide probabilities. For example, by getting predictions, we could get the probability of an outcome to be 0.95 while another to be 0.57. Although both would pass in a two category scenario, we can learn something from the difference in probabilities.\n",
    "- The results of logistic regression models are highly interpretable, with the outputs being predicted probabilities (as indicated above).\n",
    "- Another strength of this model is that it can be extended to multiple categories, while other classifiers cannot.\n",
    "- As part of its ease of implementation, logistic regression models do not require features to be scaled, and there's no need for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, it is easy to regularize.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "- Although the model is called logistic regression, it is still linear in regards to the features, which means the model will perform poorly in the presence of non-linear relationships. This can be addressed by adding interaction terms, but this needs to be done manually.\n",
    "- If feature/explanatory variables are correlated, that can cause problems with the model and its predictions. Co-linearity is general problem of linear regression models. Also, models perform better if variables that are unrelated to the dependent variable are removed.\n",
    "- In cases where the weights of the model are of interest, the interpretation of the weights can be complex, because they are multiplicative rather than additive. In addition, they generally represent percent changes rather than direct unit changes.\n",
    "- Logistic regression rely heavily on a proper problem definition. That is, it is not a useful tool unless you have already identified the important independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Logistic Regression**\n",
    "- Because the Logistic Regression classifier is one of the simplest algorithms, while providing good efficiency, it can be the baseline, or benchmark, for our problem. It is easy to implement and requires minimal tuning, which is also desirable in a baseline model. In addition, although we believe some of the relationships in data could be non-linear, it may be prudent to start with a linear model. If the relationships are in fact governed by linear processes, the linear model could be superior to the more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "**Application**\n",
    "- SVMs are used extensively in Bioinformatics, including protein and cancer classification. These models are used for the classification of genes, as well as patients on the basis of genes. Protein remote homology detection is an important problem in computational biology. Proteins are sequences of amino acids, which are relatively easy to sequence, but it's difficult to obtain their structure. Remote homologs hold a evolutionary relationship, with conserved structures and function, but not sequence similarity. The classification problem is to determine these homologs, which are sequences that belong to the same superfamily of proteins, but not the same family. SVMs are effective in performing remote homology detection. The performance of these methods depends on how the protein sequences are modelled and the method used to compute the kernel function between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**\n",
    "- According to research, SVMs can provide accurate results, when compared to other classification methods, while being computationally efficient. This stems from the fact that the models only uses a subset of training points in the decision function (support vectors), which makes them also memory efficient.\n",
    "- SVMs models can deal with non-linear relationships. Although many classification techniques can only deal with linear relationships, SVMs can separate data using more complex relationships.\n",
    "- This class of models is also effective in high dimensional spaces. SVM models perform well when the number of features is high. In addition, the model may still be effective when the number of dimensions/feature is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "- Although complexity of models can lead to overfitting, this can be controlled by using the soft margin approach. Soft margins allow for errors to be made when fitting the model to the training data.\n",
    "- SVM models are also versatile, with the users being able to choose among different Kernel function for the decision function. The sklearn library provides common kernels, but it also allows for custom variations.\n",
    "- SMVs allow for feature selection. Feature selection refers to the process of selecting a subset of the available feature space for building model. This is useful because it allows for model simplifications (making interpretation easier), faster training times, and reducing the chance of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "- According to Burges (1998), one of the biggest limitations of SVMs is the choice of the kernel. Once the kernel is chosen, there is only one user-chosen parameter - the error penalty -, and the kernel obfuscates other parameters.\n",
    "- Another limitation pointed out by Burges (1998) is speed and size of both training and testing. The author claims that althought the speed problem in the test phase is generally solved, training for very large datasets (those with millions of support vectors) is still a problem.\n",
    "- SVMs only consider two classes. This means that SVM models cannot be used for cases with more than two options for classification. Multi-class SVMs are still being researched. In addition, SVMs do not provide probability estimates, but these can technically be obtained using complex methods.\n",
    "- According to research, SVMs are also sensitive to noise. A relatively small number of mislabeled outcomes can have a large, negative impact on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why SVM**\n",
    "- The income dataset is a large dataset with a relatively large number of features. SVMs perform well in these conditions. In addition, the relationships in the data may be non-linear. For example, although education level is expected to yield positive returns (i.e. acquiring higher levels of education lead to higher income), the return from acquiring one extra level of education may not be constant among the different levels (e.g. high-school to bachelor's degree, and bachelor's to PhD). Given that SVMs can deal with more complex relationships, they are useful in this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Methods: AdaBoost with Decision Trees\n",
    "**Application**\n",
    "- Decision Trees (with or without boosting) are frequently used in customer recommendation systems. From data regarding user characteristics and behaviour, decision tree models can investigate relationships between customers' preferences and these characteristics to help build powerful recommendations. For example, in e-commerce, data gathered on user's place of residence, gender, previous purchases, interests, etc, can be used to build a selection of suggestions for future purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**\n",
    "- Decision tree models are simple to understand and interpret, as they follow the human decision process more closely than other models. Given that the boosting process is merely the repeated application of simple decision trees, the same point is also valid. In addition, with decision trees, the model can be displayed graphically which also helps understand what the model is doing.\n",
    "- Decision tree models require little data preparation, since they can handle both numerical and categorical data, while other types of model require extensive transformations (Note: in our case, the data have been already transformed in order to allow for different models to be used, which reduces the advantage of selecting a decision tree based model). In addition, decision tree models tend to work well out-of-the-box, with minimal tweaking required to get reasonable results.\n",
    "- Some researchers describe decision tree models as white box models, because there is full visibility of the processes being used by the model as they can generally be reduced to boolean logic. In contrast, in a black box model, explanation of the results is typically complex and harder to interpret (e.g. in the case of neural networks). Although this can be slightly reduced with the use of boosting (since we may not have visibility of the specific weak learners being used), the overall logic is still valid.\n",
    "- Decision trees (as well as boosting with decision trees) are also regarded as non-statistical approaches that do not require assumptions regarding the training data - e.g. no assumption regarding distribution of data, independence of features, or constant variance. This means that these models are fairly robust against co-linearity (or correlation between independent/explanatory variables).\n",
    "- These models also tend to perform well with large datasets. In addition, large amounts of data can be analyzed in reasonable time using average computing resources.\n",
    "- Although decision trees tend to overfit as models get more complex, the boosting techniques are meant to mitigate that fact by combining weak learners, slightly better than random on training data, resulting in a very strong learner. This resulting learner can generalize the data much better than a single tree.\n",
    "- Decision trees, and ensemble models based on decision trees, can generate complex non-linear models that allows for the analysis and classification of difficult problems. This is particularly enhanced by ensemble models, as they tend to extract the best of each weak learner, making improvements incremental, and allowing the different aspects of difficult problems to be handled in stages by specific learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**\n",
    "- Overfitting is one of the major problems of decision tree models. Trees can become overly complex and fit well the training data, but not generalizing the problem. Although this is a problem of the plain vanilla tree models, the use of boosting (e.g. AdaBoost) can mitigate that problem.\n",
    "- Decision trees are also vunerable to bias due to features that have data clustered around a certain value (Note: although this is generally a problem, in our case, the data transformations applied reduce this problem).\n",
    "- Decision trees can be affected by changes in the training data. Small changes in the training data can lead to large changes in the tree and the final predictions. Boosting can help mitigate this, however, given its stage-approach, where weak learners are used in an iterative process.\n",
    "- Although decision tree models are generally easy to interpret, ensemble models reduce the interpretability of the model. If for example an ensemble model is better than a linear model, it is exploiting some non-linear relationship that we may not be able to fully account for when analyzing the results.\n",
    "- If the data comes from a linear process, linear models will be much superior to ensemble models.\n",
    "- Ensemble models, somewhat in contrast with the plain decision tree models, tend to be computationally expensive, adding learning time and memory constrains to the estimations.\n",
    "- Some researchers warn that AdaBoost in particular can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. Outliers lead the model to try to correct for cases that are unrealistic, which can greatly influence the results (Note: in our case, this is not a significant problem because the data transformations applied mitigate that).\n",
    "- Because the ensemble method continues to attempt to correct misclassifications in the training data, quality of the training data is important and can greatly affect the results. High-quality training data is generally required (Note: in our case, this may not be a problem, as the data has been cleaned).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why AdaBoost with Decision Trees**\n",
    "- The income prediction problem is complex, with several features that may or may not be correlated. In addition, we have a relatively large dataset. AdaBoost with decision trees can be useful in these situations. By applying small trees that are good at partially explaining the problem, the boosting can assemble one final model that is strong and can provide efficient results.\n",

    "Based on the preliminary evaluation of the three models chosen, the AdaBoost with Decision Trees model is the most efficient and effective model. When 100% of the training data is used, the AdaBoost model shows the highest F-score, at around 0.7, while also showing extremely low times for estimation. This means we are getting relatively good results - keeping in mind that these are results from an un-tuned model - in short amounts of computation time (under 1 second).\n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoost model using decision trees is suitable for the problem. Firstly, we have a relatively large number of observations and features, which this kind of model works well on. Secondly, it is possible that some of the relationships are non-linear and features may be correlated. Although some models cannot account for those aspects or perform poorly under those circumstances (e.g. Logistic regression), the AdaBoost with decision trees makes no assumptions regarding the data and can account for non-linear effects. Lastly, the model greatly outperforms the naive predictor - which has a F-score of approximately 0.3 - and outperforms the other model when applied to the testing set. This indicates that the model is going in the right direction, and is therefore suitable for classifying the potential donors."

    "The model chosen attempts to combine many simpler, weaker models - which alone are bad for generating predictions - into one strong model that can make accurate predictions.

The final, stronger model combines the strengths of each of these models - extracting from them what they do best.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, each of the simpler models is a decision tree: basically, a series of \"yes-or-no\" questions used to classify the data. For each model, we ask a simple question for classifying the data: for example, should an individual who have only high school education be expected to make more or less than 50K? This first model will make many mistakes, because it is too simple to address the overall problem - but that's ok! We then identify for which data points it made mistakes and enhance (or enlarge) those mistakes. We do this so the next simple model applied will be focused on repairing the mistakes made by the first one; after that, the third model will focus on the mistakes made by the second one, and so on. Once we are done with this process, we assign weights to each of the simple models, as a way to establish how valuable their prediction is to the final result - just imagine that each model is voting for a certain prediction (i.e. above or below 50K) and their weights determine how much we should \"listen\" to that model. Combining the votes from each model adjusted by their weights gives us the final prediction."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The five most important features are: hours-per-week, occupation, age, education, and race (from most to least important).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Hours-per-week:** the number of hours worked per week is crucial for determining an individual's annual income. It is very unlikely that an individual that works part-time can generate enough income to be in the \"over 50K\" group. For example, even if an individual makes 40 dollars an hour, which is significantly higher than the minimum wage in any US state, that would equate to only 38K annually if the occupation was part-time, but over 76K if full-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Occupation:** for a variety of reasons (e.g. demand, perceived importance, difficulty, risk, etc), the compensation for different occupation can vary greatly, making occupation an important determinant of income. Some professions command higher salaries than others, and the differences can be significant. For example, all else equal, a manager will tend to have a much higher salary than an office assistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Education:** workers with higher levels of education command higher wages, and can therefore achieve higher income levels. This is known as the education premium. Because the ability of completing higher levels of education is associated with higher skills and ability, workers that have completed higher education levels tend to be rewarded with higher salaries. In some studies, the education premium is shown to be as high as 30% for workers holding a bachelor degree in comparison to those with only high-school education.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Age:** although age itself is not a determinant of income - in the US, it generally cannot be used for employment discrimination -, age is an approximation of experience. All else equal, older workers on average have been working for longer, and have accumulated on-the-job experience. This experience leads to a pay premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Race:** many studies have shown that due to systematic discrimination there seems to be a black-white wage disparity in the US (and other countries as well). Many studies show that black workers tend to earn significantly less than white workers, all else equal (that is, same occupation, education level, and experience, among other factors). Although in some cases the white wage premium is not be as high as the premium related to the factors above, it is still a significant determinant of income."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Out of the five most important features identified above, the answer to question 6 included three of them, namely \"age\", \"hours-per-week\" and \"education\". The ones missing from were the features related to capital gains/losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In answering question 6, more emphasis was given to features affecting wages, rather than considering income as whole. Wages and salaries are one of the components of income - albeit, an important one. By investing their savings, individuals can generate extra income - or incur losses - which directly impact their overall income. Capital gains/losses are, therefore, also important determinants of income. In addition to giving more emphasis to wages, in analyzing the problem, the answer to question 6 assumed that a relatively small proportion of the individuals in the dataset had significant capital gains/losses. Although that could be the case, those cases played an important role in classifying individuals into the income groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another discrepancy between the answer to question 6 and the results above is the ranking of the features. Firstly, age (which is an approximation of experience) is the most important features, not hours worked per week (when considering only the overlapping features). This means that, according to the data, the economy places a large premium on experience, and perhaps the prevalence of part-time workers is not high enough to meaningfully affect the classification process. Secondly, education has a smaller weight (and therefore impact) than age on the results. This is an interesting finding and can be interpreted as the economy placing more value on experience than on education. In countries where a large proportion of the population has higher levels of education, we expect that the relative value of education is lower; moreover, if the population is also relatively young (i.e. less experienced), the value of experience increases. It is difficult to determine which effect dominates prior to the analysis, however. Lastly, and somewhat surprisingly, occupation and race are not among the most relevant features of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, although there's some overlap, the answer to question 6 shows some important differences when compared to the results above. Notably, capital gains/losses play an important role in determining the income group of an individual. This should have been expected, as these variables directly affect income - having a one-to-one relationship with it. Perhaps too much focus was given to variables that determine wages, instead of an overall assessment of income. Furthermore, the ranking of the overlapping features is also incorrect, but that is to be expected since determining the relative effects of different features prior to rigorous analysis is very difficult."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
